        question: "What's the difference between LLMs.txt and robots.txt?",
        answer: "While robots.txt controls how search engine crawlers access your website, LLMs.txt is designed specifically for AI language models. It provides a structured, human-readable summary of your content to help AI systems better understand and interact with your website."
      },
      {
        question: "Will LLMs.txt improve my SEO?",
        answer: "LLMs.txt isn't directly related to traditional SEO, but as AI-powered search becomes more prevalent, having a well-structured LLMs.txt file can improve how your content is understood and referenced by AI systems, potentially increasing visibility in AI-driven search experiences."

      {
        question: "Do I need to update my LLMs.txt file regularly?",
        answer: "Yes, it's recommended to update your LLMs.txt file whenever your website structure changes significantly or when you add important new content. This ensures AI models have the most accurate and up-to-date information about your site."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if my LLMs.txt file is working?",
        answer: "You can test your LLMs.txt implementation by asking AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT questions about your website. If they provide accurate answers and properly attribute information to your site, your LLMs.txt file is likely working effectively."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I customize the LLMs.txt file after generation?",
        answer: "Absolutely! The generated file is a starting point. You're encouraged to customize it by adding more detailed information, organizing it into logical sections, and highlighting your most important content to maximize its effectiveness."
